## 📖  Description

This application allows the user to keep track of Engineers and Machines in Dr. Sillystringz's Factory. The user can add Machines to an Engineer who is licensed to do so and add Engineers to a Machine. 

This is the Independent Project for Epicodus week 11 as part of the "Many-to-Many Relationships" coursework.

## 🔧 Setup & Requirements

### 📋 Necessary Specifications

#### To run this project locally you will need:

- **ASP .NET Core :** You can check if you have .NET Core by running `dotnet --version` in the command line. If you do not have .NET Core please find more information and download [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core)
- **MySQL :**  You can download MySQL [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484914) and MySQL Workbench [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484391)
- **Prefered Code Editor**


### ⚙️ Clone or Download

#### To Download:

Go to my GitHub repository here, [https://guthub.com/kaila.spraguemcrae/FINISH-URL](https://guthub.com/kaila.spraguemcrae/FINISH-URL), and click on the green 'Code' button to clone the repository, Open with GitHub Desktop OR Download the ZIP file

#### To clone (my prefered method):

1. Push the green 'Clone' button and copy the URL.
2. Open Terminal or GitBash and input the command: `git clone https://github.com/kaila-spraguemcrae/FINISH-URL`
3. To view the code, open the copied directory with Visual Studio Code or your preferred text editor by inputing the command `code .` in your terminal.

### 🧰 Database Setup Options

#### AppSettings (option 1):

- After you have the project on your computer you will need to create a file in the root directory of the project called "appsettings.json". 
- Add the following snippet of code to the appsettings.json file:

```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=kaila_spraguemcrae_factory;uid=root;pwd=YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE;"
    }
}
```
*Please note you will need to replace `YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE` with the password you created for your MySQL server.

#### Import Database using Entity Framework Core (option 1 continued):

 - In the command line run ` cd Desktop/Factory.Solution/Factory` to navigate to the "Factory" folder. 
 - Next, run `dotnet ef database update` to generate the database. You can confirm the database was created by checking MySQL workbench.

*to make changed to the database you can run `dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName>`

#### Import Database using MySQL Workbench (option 2):

- Open MySQL workbench and go to the navigation bar and select `Server > Data Import`. 
- Next, select the option `Import from Self-Contained File` and confirm you have the file `kaila_spraguemcrae_factory.sql` set to be imported (this files exists in the root directory of this project). 
- Then, set the `Defaul Target Schema` or create a new schema and select all the the Schema Objects you want to be imported. 
- Check that the option `Dump Structure and Data` is selected. Once you confirm you have all of the correct settings click `Start Import`.

#### Import Database using SQL Schema (option 3):

- Open your MySQL management tool and paste the following Create Statement to generate the database:

```
CREATE DATABASE `kaila_spraguemcrae_factory` /*!40100 DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci */;

CREATE TABLE `__EFMigrationsHistory` (
  `MigrationId` varchar(95) NOT NULL,
  `ProductVersion` varchar(32) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`MigrationId`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;

CREATE TABLE `EngineerMachine` (
  `EngineerMachineId` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `EngineerId` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `MachineId` int(11) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`EngineerMachineId`),
  KEY `IX_EngineerMachine_EngineerId` (`EngineerId`),
  KEY `IX_EngineerMachine_MachineId` (`MachineId`),
  CONSTRAINT `FK_EngineerMachine_Engineers_EngineerId` FOREIGN KEY (`EngineerId`) REFERENCES `engineers` (`EngineerId`) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  CONSTRAINT `FK_EngineerMachine_Machines_MachineId` FOREIGN KEY (`MachineId`) REFERENCES `machines` (`MachineId`) ON DELETE CASCADE
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=17 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;

CREATE TABLE `Engineers` (
  `EngineerId` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `FirstName` longtext,
  `LastName` longtext,
  PRIMARY KEY (`EngineerId`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=7 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;

CREATE TABLE `Machines` (
  `MachineId` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `MachineName` longtext,
  PRIMARY KEY (`MachineId`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=7 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
```

#### Running/viewing application:

1. Once you have opened the code in your preferred text editor you will need to navigate to the 'PROJNAME' folder (`cd PROJNAME`) in the command line and run `dotnet run` or `dotnet watch run`.
2. At this point you should be able to click on the link to the local server's url path to view the compiled project.
