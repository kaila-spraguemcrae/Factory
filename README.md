3. To view the code, open the copied directory with Visual Studio Code or your preferred text editor by inputing the command `code .` in your terminal.


#### AppSettings:

After you have the project on your computer you will need to create a file in the root directory of the project called "appsettings.json". Add the following snippet of code to the appsettings.json file:

```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=kaila_spraguemcrae_factory;uid=root;pwd=YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE;"
    }
}
